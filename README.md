# Webcam Activity â†’ Hue Light

MacOS only.

1. Get and install [OverSight](https://objective-see.com/products/oversight.html) (Free, closed source)
2. Configure as such:
   ![oversight-config](readme_images/oversight-config.png)
3. This is a bit weird but don't "always allow" your apps. This will mute them from logging.
4. Instead, shush up the notifications. Change the type to "Banner" (suggested) or "None."
   ![oversight-notifications](readme_images/oversight-notifications.png)
5. This dumb-ass app will just watch the log file of OverSight Helper. On first run it will create an API user (see example cribbed from [GitHub](https://github.com/peter-murray/node-hue-api/blob/master/examples/v3/discoverAndCreateUserScript.js)). In subsequent runs, you can customize the LIGHT_ID, or see examples [how to search lights by name](https://github.com/peter-murray/node-hue-api/blob/master/examples/v3/lights/getLightByName.js).
6. Add to launch agents, wrap in applescript, or add to Login Items, or your favourite way to launch the script once per login session.
